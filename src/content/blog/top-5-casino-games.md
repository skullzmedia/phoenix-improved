It is a classic casino game where the players bet that the small ball will land on the spinning wheel, which is divided into slots. The wheel has red and black colors with green slots for zero. Players can place bets on a number, groups of numbers, or colors. The game brings a hell of excitement when the ball bounces around the wheel.

### Rank 3: Three Card Poker-Three Cards, Numerous Possibilities
Securing number 3 on our list is 3 card poker. With so many poker variations, it is hard to pinpoint which poker game is more popular, but this variation is no doubt prevalent here in the best casino in South Goa. Three-card poker aims to make the best poker hand using only three cards. The primary reason why this game is so popular is that it is easy to learn where players only play with dealers. The game is specially designed for entertainment and is the best game for those who are playing in a casino for the first time. In short, it is a fun and fast-paced game.

### Rank 4: Sic Bo- Where Every Roll is Shot of Glory
Sic Bo is a thrilling game played in casinos in Goa. Its popularity is due to its straightforward game rules. The game is played by placing the bets on the outcomes of three dice. Players will place wagers on specific results like the total that can come or the combination of numbers that can come after rolling three dice. After the bets are placed, the dealer will roll the die, and the winners will be paid. The game can offer you significant payouts, thus making it a widely played game in the Goa casinos.

Dragon Tiger is one of the favorites of both novice and experienced players in Goa casinos. The game uses minimal strategy, making it easy to learn and play. Here, the players will place bets on either Dragon or Tiger with a card that is dealt to them. Dragon cards are ranked from A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-K- with King being the highest.
