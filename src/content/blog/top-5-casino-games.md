### Rank 3: Three Card Poker-Three Cards, Numerous Possibilities
Securing number 3 on our list is 3 card poker. With so many poker variations, it is hard to pinpoint which poker game is more popular, but this variation is no doubt prevalent here in the best casino in South Goa. Three-card poker aims to make the best poker hand using only three cards. The primary reason why this game is so popular is that it is easy to learn where players only play with dealers.

### Rank 4: Sic Bo- Where Every Roll is Shot of Glory
Sic Bo is a thrilling game played in casinos in Goa. Its popularity is due to its straightforward game rules. The game is played by placing the bets on the outcomes of three dice. Players will place wagers on specific results like the total that can come or the combination of numbers that can come after rolling three dice. After the bets are placed, the dealer will roll the die, and the winners will be paid. The game can offer you significant payouts, thus making it a widely played game in the Goa casinos.
